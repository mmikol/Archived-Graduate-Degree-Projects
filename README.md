# Archived Class Projects

This is a compilation of all projects completed throughout my graduate study at University of Southern California. Note that project completion (in terms of passing tests and meeting specs) is not always guaranteed to have received a grade of 100%. These projects highlight both my exposure to programming languages and conventions along with my growth as a programmer.
